# HandTracker
Real-time hand tracking using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe. This project detects and tracks hand positions in live video, identifying key landmarks like fingertips. It's ideal for gesture recognition and interactive applications. The implementation combines MediaPipeâ€™s models with OpenCV for efficient image processing.
