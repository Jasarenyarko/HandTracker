**Hand Tracker using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe**

Overview

This project implements a real-time hand tracking system using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe. The application detects and tracks the position of hands in live video streams, identifying key landmarks such as fingertips and knuckles. It is ideal for use in gesture recognition, virtual controls, and other interactive applications.

**Features**

Real-time hand detection and tracking.
Identification of key hand landmarks (e.g., fingertips, knuckles).
Extendable for gesture recognition and interactive applications.

**Requirements**
